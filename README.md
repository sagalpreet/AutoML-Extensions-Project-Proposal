## Answer: 114

With updated value for random seed (i.e. 11), the first change of champion occurs at example **114**.

Used python script to programatically update champion change value in the code. The idea is simply to iterate over all possible values and re-build for the unit-test and run tests until no error is encountered.

The python script can be accessed from script.py.
